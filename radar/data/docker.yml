  Docker is our primary container platform for packaging and deploying applications.
  We use it extensively across all projects for consistent development and production environments.

  **Key Benefits:**
  - Ensures consistency across different environments
  - Simplifies dependency management
  - Enables easy scaling and orchestration

  **Usage:**
  - Development environments via docker-compose
  - CI/CD pipelines for building and testing
  - Production deployments
